### Hey there, I'm Kate! ðŸ‘‹

UX/UI designer and front-end developer

I love working with clients to translate their brand design, strategy and online presence into an outcome that resonates with their customers, and helps drive results for their business.

Sometimes that means creating an entire brand strategy from colour palette to typography to brand material, or designing and building a business website, or even improving the usability and aesthetic of an existing app.

The rest of the time, you will find me outside in the sun (I live by the beach in Sydney!), going for a run or mountain bike ride, playing old school Pokemon, or annoying a loved one.

ðŸ’¬ To get in touch, please contact me through my business site [katehobbs.com.au](https://katehobbs.com.au).
